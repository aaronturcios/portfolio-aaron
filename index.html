<p class="abouttext">
Growing up I found myself looking for ways to solve peopleâ€™s problems or make things easier for them. This manifested itself in color coding a remote for my grandmother or looking up left handed shooting tips for a friend. 
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
Then as I progressed in a career in real estate, I would leverage newly developed technologies such as client resource management systems or scheduling platforms to simplify the process and make this giant life moment easier to navigate for my clients. 
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
Slowly, my enthusiasm shifted from aiding people in purchasing homes to researching the newest tools that were becoming available. This naturally lead to an interest in the development of these tools and my first intro to HTML course. 
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
Now, I look forward to building the tools others use to make their lives easier.
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
In my free time I enjoy writing/performing comedy, eating burritos, and pontificating about the media circus that is the NBA.
